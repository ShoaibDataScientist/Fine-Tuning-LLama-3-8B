# Fine-Tuning-LLama-3-8B
Finetuning Llama 3 for  the specific use case
This code represents a comprehensive process for fine-tuning and deploying large language models, specifically focusing on the LLama-3 model with 8 billion parameters. Here's a breakdown of the major steps:

Model Preparation: The code begins with the setup of the LLama-3 model, including its tokenization and loading it with 4-bit quantization to optimize memory usage.
Integration of LoRA Adapters: LoRA adapters are integrated into the model to efficiently update a fraction of the model's parameters, improving training speed and reducing computational load.
Data Preparation: The Alpaca dataset is used for training, with a focus on preparing prompts in a specific format for instruction, input, and response. This involves defining a system prompt and applying it to the dataset.
Training the Model: The model's training setup is configured, including parameters such as batch size, learning rate, and number of training epochs. The model is then trained on the prepared dataset.
Inference: Once trained, the model is used for inference by providing instructions and inputs to generate outputs. Inference can be performed either directly or via a text streamer for continuous generation.
Saving and Loading Models: Finally, the trained model is saved in various formats, including LoRA adapters only, merged to 16-bit or 4-bit, and saved with different quantization methods. These models can then be uploaded for sharing or deployment.
Compression and Deployment: The model can be further compressed using quantization methods like Q8_0, 16-bit GGUF, or q4_k_m GGUF for efficient deployment, particularly in resource-constrained environments.
